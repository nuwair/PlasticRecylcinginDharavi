During spring break group of second year engineering students from New York University 
Abu Dhabi went to Dharavi, Mumbai as a part of Engineers for Social Impact course. This
year students were carrying out the last years projects, where our team continued working 
on the concept of space optimization. Before leaving to Dharavi, we decided to shift our 
approach and concentrate on materials available on the site and then think about the 
design of last. The decision fell to use plastics as a material due to the extensive 
recycling industry in the community. On the site we have found that space inside of 
the house was already optimized according to the needs of household members. From 
that point onwards, our main goal was to get educated about the plastic recycling 
industry as the machineries used in the 13th compound are optimized to minimize 
energy expenses and fit the space available in the workshops. In collaboration 
with Urbz organisation and guidance of our faculty member, we have been  working 
on collecting data about plastic recycling that we are willing to share on this website.
