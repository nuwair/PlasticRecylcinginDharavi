								<h1>Types of <font style="color:green;"> Plastics</h1></font>
								There are around 100 types of plastics. The most common plastic is PP but there are different qualities and types of plastic in PP (Polypropylene). PP itself has around five types; even HD (High Density) has several types. There is also the glass PP, which is PP, mixed with glass. The transparent cost of the plastic depends on the quality and the strength of the plastic. For example, if it was virgin plastic (A) grade, which is considered high quality plastic due to never recycled before, then it will cost 75 rupees per Kg. While-the not virgin plastic (C) grade will cost around 25 rupees. The price of recycled virgin (B) grade is from 30-70 rupees per Kg .  The most expensive plastic is the virgin plastic because it has the best quality. Transparent virgin plastic cost around 70 rupees per Kg. The HD(High Density) and the LD(Low Density) plastic types are the cheapest. For instance, they get 4 to 5 rupees per 1 kg on plastic bags, which is an LD type. The rest of the plastic type such as PP (Polypropylene) is 10 to 12 rupees per Kg. Virgin material such as polycarbonate, however, cost around 40 to 45 rupees/kg.  
There are buyers of plastic inside and outside of Dharavi. The buyers inside of Dharavi are known as scrap shops while, the buyers outside of Dharavi are manufacturing factories that are interested in producing goods from recycled plastic.
