<h3>About us</h3>
During spring break group of second year engineering students from New

York University Abu Dhabi went to Dharavi, Mumbai as a part of Engineers

for Social Impact course. This year students were carrying out the last years

projects, where our team continued working on the concept of space optimization. 
Before leaving to Dharavi, we decided to shift our approach and concentrate on materials
 available on the site and then think about the design of last.

The decision fell to use plastics as a material due to the extensive recycling

industry in the community. On the site we have found that space inside of

the house was already optimized according to the needs of household members.

From that point onwards, our main goal was to get educated about the plastic

recycling industry as the machineries used in the 13th compound are optimized

to minimize energy expenses and fit the space available in the workshops. In

collaboration with Urbz organisation and guidance of our faculty member, we

have been working on collecting data about plastic recycling that we are willing

to share on this website.
